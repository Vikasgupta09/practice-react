/**
 * React patterns
 * --------------
 * - context-api pattern
 * when we pass prop to a deeply nested component its pretty hard
 * this pattern allows us to access this props, wrap your component with a specific tag
 * consumer component is used anywhere we want to use that prop
 *
 * - render props
 * using child as component
 *
 * - presentation component pattern
 *
 * - css-in-js pattern

/**
 * Why to use React ?
 * ------------------
 * - Depends on the nature of the project
 * - Depends upon the size of the project
 * - compare to angular, angular is hard to use, need to remember a lot of syntax
 *      react is functional programming allows us to use a lot of JS
