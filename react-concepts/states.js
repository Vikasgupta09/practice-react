/**
 * State
 * -----
 *
 * - works only with class based component
 * (note: can work with function based too using hooks now)
 * - state looks similar to props but it is not
 * - it is a JS object that contains some data relevant to component
 * - updating state causes rerender
 * - state must be initialied when a component is first created
 * - state can only be updated using 'setState'
